The Lion Kingis about a young lion cub named Simba. He’s the prince and heir of Pride Rock. During the musical, Simba goes on a life-changing journey through the Pride Lands but must defeat Mufasa’s brother Scar who dreams of ascending to the throne. Can Simba face the world and roar louder than ever before? The Lion Kingis an incredible experience for the whole family. Over 200 puppets bring the majesty of the Serengeti Plains and the evocative rhythms of Africa to life, set against a timeless score by Elton John and Tim Rice, with beloved songs like “Can You Feel the Love Tonight,” and “I Just Can’t Wait to Be King.” The Lion Kingsongs incorporate six different African languages: Swahili, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, and Congolese, into the lyrics.

Lin-Manuel Miranda’s groundbreaking musical centres on the life of one of America’s founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton, who was a key figure in shaping the nation. The award-winning hit features a mash-up of hip-hop, R&B, and soul songs performed by a diverse cast. Orphaned at a young age, Hamilton moved to New York in the hope of a better life. While there, there he impressed those around him with his hunger for revolution and reform. The story sees Hamilton become George Washington's right-hand man, fall in love, and go on to become the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. The seeds for theHamiltonmusical were planted when composer Lin-Manuel Miranda purchased a copy of Ron Chernow's biography,Alexander Hamilton. Within a few pages, Miranda started to envision the revolutionary's life in musical form and embarked on the project in 2009 by penningThe Hamilton Mixtape— a number of songs that would later go on to form the show. During this time, he was invited to the White House to perform at an evening of Poetry, Music, and Spoken Word in front of President Barack Obama and the First Lady. He treated audiences to the song ""Alexander Hamilton"", which was met with scattered laughter from the crowd. After workshopping the mixtape,Hamiltonfinally received its Off-Broadway premiere at the Public Theater in 2015 before later transferring to Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. Hamiltonhas left a major impression on audiences since it first premiered Off-Broadway in 2015. The show offers a unique perspective of one of the lesser-known founding fathers using an innovative approach to make the story more relevant and engaging to a modern audience with its infusion of hip-hop and rap and commitment to diverse casting. The musical won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, making it the first musical to win the award since 2010 and the 9th musical to win the accolade since 1930.Hamiltonwent on to win 11 Tony Awards, six Olivier Awards, and the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. In a five-star review on London Theatre, our critic raves:“Just as Les Miserables has proved to be a universal story, stretching far beyond its deeply etched story of revenge, retribution and revolution to speak to a human need for healing and forgiveness, so Hamilton captures the heartbeat and heartbreak of a nation trying to find itself - and relates it directly to a pursuit it is still engaged in trying to define anew today” Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote theHamiltonmusical. His Hamilton score features a fusion of emotive songs that combine hip-hop, R&B, soul, and classical musical theatre numbers, while the musical is entirely sung-through by its cast. Since its premiere, Hamilton shot into the public consciousness. It won 11 Tony Awards, including Outstanding Musical and all four acting categories. London welcomed the West End production ofHamiltonin 2017 at the newly refurbished Victoria Palace Theatre. The musical won a record-equalling seven Olivier Awards, including Best Musical and Outstanding Achievement in Music.Hamiltonin London has well and truly found a second home.

South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, known for their daring approach to pushing the boundaries on controversial topics, teamed up with Robert Lopez to co-writeThe Book of Mormon. Development began in 2003 when they conceived the idea of writing a musical based around Joseph Smith, the Church of Latter-Day Saints founder. Follow the journey of two missionaries who dream of serving in Orlando, only to be told they must serve in Uganda. While in Africa, they share their scriptures with the local community. The locals don’t care about what they have to say: AIDS, famine, and warlords pose a more significant threat. Join Elder Price and Elder Cunningham as they spread the gospel and attempt to make every day a latter day. While The Book of Mormon satirises the Christian denomination, it accurately sheds light on Mormon ideas and practices. It’s common for young men to serve a two-year mission and spread their faith worldwide — just like Elder Price and Elder Cunningham. The Book of Mormonhas delighted audiences for years with its irreverent humour and unapologetic wit. The show bravely tackles complex social commentary and dives into topics often considered taboo, set to catchy songs that you’ll be humming long after the curtain call. After winning nine Tony Awards on Broadway,The Book of Mormonopened in the West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 2013. The show arrived in London to instant success, winning four Olivier Awards, including Best New Musical.Find out more about The Book of Mormon in London.

She’s an extraordinary little girl who, armed with a vivid imagination, a sharp mind, and telekinetic powers, dares to take a stand and change her destiny. When she faces Crunchem Hall headmistress Miss Trunchbull, she must challenge those above her for the greater good. Can Matilda, Miss Honey, and her classmates do the unthinkable and defeat Trunchbull? Watch them swing through the auditorium and revolt their way to a resolution. Matilda the Musicalstands out above the rest due to its small but mighty lead character.

The show will inspire audiences of all ages, as cast member Elliot Harper attested:“It’s very sophisticated and adult audiences get a kick out of following the story because it's pretty nuanced. There's also a lot for children and younger people to enjoy. It's very vivid and comic book in its storytelling.” Roald Dahl's 1988 children's story of the same name informs the Matilda show.

This smash hit musical based on the thrilling story of legendary pop star Michael Jackson comes straight from Broadway, featuring Myles Frost in his West End debut. Frost made his Broadway debut and won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for transforming into the late King of Pop, making him the youngest solo recipient of the award in history. MJ the Musicalcentres around rehearsals for Michael Jackson’s 1992 Dangerous World Tour. When an MTV camera crew arrives to interview Jackson for a documentary, the singer gradually opens up about his turbulent backstory and career. His memories come to life with some of his most famous songs, including “Billie Jean,” “Beat It,” “Thriller,” and “Smooth Criminal,” and a book by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage. This production provides a unique look into the unseen elements — including his family relationships, phenomenal talent, and creative imagination — that inspired Jackson’s singular approach to music. As on Broadway, Christopher Wheeldon OBE directs and choreographsMJin London. He won a Tony Award for his choreography, which he co-created with Rich and Tone Talauega, two of Jackson’s former backup dancers and collaborators. They helped Wheeldon to ensure the choreography in the show replicated the pop star’s signature style. Elizabeth Taylor named Michael Jackson The King of Pop at the 1989 Soul Train Awards, and it is fair to say that he is an artist like no other. With over 350 million records sold worldwide, Jackson has earned himself spots in the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. He is also the only music artist in the Dance Hall of Fame. MJ the Musicaltickets are available on London Theatre now.

This irresistibly funny ABBA musical comedy follows an original story of love, friendship and the search for identity accompanied by a score of some of the most recognisable and uplifting pop music ever written. Set on a Greek island paradise, theMamma Mia!musical tells the story of the newly engaged Sophie who is determined to find out the identity of her father and invite them to her wedding. Without telling her mother Donna, she writes to the three possible candidates and they all arrive just in time to see her walk down the aisle. The only question is, which one of the three very different men is it? It took a long time forMamma Mia!to come to life. Producer Judy Craymer spent a decade convincing Benny Anderson and Björn Ulvaeus to use their songs in a musical. Eventually, they were won over andMamma Mia!was born. The original London production features an incredibly talented cast of performers and musicians who bring this colourful and exciting story to life. Fans of the 2008 movie musical will also be delighted to see the show in its original form, so escape to this idyllic island paradise and enjoy the West End's greatest party. As one of the world's most successful and recognisable musical titles, it leaves audiences on their feet night after night. There's a host of hit ABBA songs including “Money Money Money,” “Take a Chance on Me,"", “Does Your Mother Know,” and “The Winner Takes it All.""

Italian writer and essayist Stefano Massini's play opened as an Italian-speaking production, with performances in Paris and Milan. Ben Power then adapted the financial drama from Italian to English. British dramaturg Ben Power previously adapted Euripides’sMedeaand three D. H. Lawrence stories intoHusbands and Sons. The Lehman Trilogypremiered at the National Theatre in 2018, and later transferred to the Piccadilly Theatre.You don’t need a finance and mathematics background to understand what happens to the Lehmans. In afive-star review ofThe Lehman Trilogyfor London Theatre, our critic said: ""The production is epic. The singular alchemy of acting, design and direction in this production is so superb that it must be witnessed."" In 2021, the play transferred to Broadway and won five Tonys, including Best Play, Best Director (for Sam Mendes), and Best Actor (for Simon Russell Beale). Now,The Lehman Trilogyreturns to London for a limited West End season at the Gillian Lynne Theatre. What happened to the Lehman brothers? It all starts in 1844, when Henry Lehman, a young man from Bavaria with a big dream, emigrated to New York. With the help of his two brothers, Emanuel and Mayer, the Lehman Brothers bank is born. From here, audiences watch a whistlestop tour of 163 years of banking history through three generations of the family, following the establishment of the bank, and its doomed fate which led to the biggest global financial collapse in history, affecting each and every one of us.

When she chooses to marry below her social class, her brothers eventually find out they seek to punish her. But will their punishments have consequences?

This summer, check intoFawlty Towers, the world’s most chaotic hotel, in the West End. Book tickets forFawlty Towerson London Theatre today. In this new comic play, the characters we know and love are all present and correct and nothing at the genteel Torquay hotel is running smoothly – it’s more of a madhouse than a spot for a weekend by the sea. Basil is in a bother of his own making, Sybil is gossiping, Manuel is struggling with his English, and Polly is trying to hold everything together. Adapted for the stage by John Cleese, who co-created the original TV show with Connie Booth and remains synonymous with the role of Basil Fawlty, the show is based on three of the best-loved episodes: “The Hotel Inspectors”, “Communication Problems”, and “The Germans”. Basil is paranoid that there’s an inspector in his midst, the bad-tempered “guest from hell”, Mrs Richards, in on his case while he tries to hide his gambling from Sybil, and he’s outrageously insensitive towards a group of German visitors while suffering the effects of a concussion. Enjoy three hilariously farcical storylines in one evening! Adam Jackson-Smith (The Girl on the Train, The 39 Steps) steps into Cleese’s shoes as the permanently harassed Basil who openly despises most of his guests. Anna-Jane Casey (Cabaret, Mother Goose) plays his formidable wife and co-manager Sybil.

Henry VIII’s ex-wives finally get the spotlight they deserve in this historical reimagining. Experience the ultimate pop concert as Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr tell you their stories in a series of girlband-esque performances.Sixfeatures an all-female cast and all-female band with a score that takes inspiration from pop superstars, such as Adele, Ariana Grande, Avril Lavigne, Jessie J, and more. Sixtells the story of the six wives of Henry VIII like you've never heard before. It brings the queens - Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr — right into the 21st century with a score that includes power ballads, techno beats, and absolute anthems for an unforgettable lesson in history and girl power. There are plenty of incredibly catchy songs by writing team Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, including “Get Down,” “All You Wanna Do,” and “Haus of Holbein” — a techno-infused song based on the German painter. We're familiar with the rhyme from history class: divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived. But we never had the opportunity to learn much more about the lives of Henry VIII’s infamous wives.Sixis a bold reimagining that delves into their stories with a diverse cast, contemporary references, catchy songs, sparkling costumes, and a heavy dose of female empowerment. The musical is perfect for those who only have time for a short show, with a run time of 75 minutes. In a review on London Theatre, our critic raves:“Mixing pop concert with theatre, it's a big, joyful welcome to non-traditional audiences and in particular to younger ones, who eagerly whip out their phones to record the finale; rather than fearing social media, Six rules it. It's the jolt of energy that the West End needs.” Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss wrote Six the Musical in their final year at Cambridge University.

Shakespeare's primary source for the story was Raphael Holinshed'sChronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande.Richard IIis the first in a tetralogy of historical plays, followed byHenry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2, andHenry V. Richard IIis a play that had its first recorded performance on 9 December 1595 at the house of Edward Hoby in Canon Row. Through the centuries, the classic play has been staged numerous times worldwide. John Gieguld's portrayal of Richard II at the Old Vic Theatre in 1929 is considered one of the most notable performances of the role, and it helped bringRichard IIback into the spotlight after it had seen a lack of popularity at the beginning of the twentieth century. Since then, the role of Richard II has been played by many exceptional actors, including Maurice Evans, Mark Rylance, Ian McKellen, and now Jonathan Bailey. This revival at the Bridge Theatre has an exceptional creative team, including Tony and Olivier-winning director Nicholas Hytner (The History of Boys, Carousel), Tony and Olivier-winning designer Bob Crowley (Mary Poppins, An American in Paris), and Olivier-winning lighting designer Bruno Poet (Frankenstein)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,"10th February, 2025"  ,"10th May, 2025"       ,               ,Bridge Theatre                          ,"3 Potters Fields Park, London, United Kingdom, SE1 2SG"

Bienvenue. Welcome to the Kit Kat Club. The Playhouse Theatre is newly transformed, so get ready to step into a theatrical paradise.Cabarettickets are available on London Theatre now. Set in early 1930s Berlin, American writer Cliff Bradshaw meets English cabaret singer Sally Bowles, a performer at the Kit Kat Club. But the rise of Nazism threatens this hedonistic Weimar Republic haven. Cabaret’s enduring success is partly down to Kander and Ebb’s indelible score, with songs like “Wilkommen,” “Don’t Tell Mama,” “Meir Herr,” “Money,” and, or course, the great torch song “Maybe This Time.” This production offers an exciting chance to discover, or revisit, Kander and Ebb’s still hugely resonant musical. The Cabaret London musical won seven Olivier Awards, with original cast members Eddie Redmayne, Jessie Buckley, Liza Sadovy, and Elliot Levey. The show features luxury casting, as well as a transformed theatre to provide optimum watching for one of the most-known musicals of all time. Rebecca Frecknall directs, with Tom Scutt providing set and costume design, and choreography by Julia Cheng. The celebratedCabaretmusical opened on Broadway in November 1966, directed by Harold Prince, and has been a hit on both stage and screen, with Bob Fosse’s film version, starring Liza Minnelli, winning eight Oscars. Dame Judi Dench led the original West End version, and, in 1993, Sam Mendes’s Donmar Warehouse production, starring Jane Horrocks and Alan Cumming, was greatly acclaimed. Cumming returned for the 2014 Broadway revival, which starred first Michelle Williams, then Emma Stone, and finally Sienna Miller. Cabaret is based on Christopher Isherwood’s short stories in Goodbye to Berlin, and John Van Druten’s play,I Am a Camera. Harold Prince led the Cabaret musical creation, teaming up with Joe Masteroff, John Kander and Fred Ebb to bring the stories to life. Find out more about Cabaret in London.

BookA Midsummer Night's Dreamtickets on London Theatre. A Midsummer Night's Dreamis a play that explores order and disorder, love and marriage, and reality versus appearance as it tells the tale of four lovers leaving Athens and stumbling into a magical fairy forest where tricks, magic, and romance abound. A Midsummer Night's Dreamin London stars Mathew Baynton (Ghosts, Horrible Histories) as Bottom, and it boasts an exceptional creative team led by director Eleanor Rhode (Teddy, Mrs. Wickham). The creative team also includes set and costume designer Lucy Osborne (Berlusconi A New Musical), illusion director and designer John Bulleid (Bronco Billy), lighting designer Matt Daw (Asteroid City, The Last Ship), composer Will Gregory (King John), sound designer Pete Malkin (Death of a Salesman), video designer Will Duke (The Encounter), and movement director Annie-Lunnette Deakin-Foster (Othello). The Guardian's 5-star review said, ""A production's panache is easily attributed to a director but this feels clearly a team effort, with Lucy Osborne's design, John Bulleid's illusions, Matt Daw's lighting and Pete Malkin's sound also excelling in the dazzling inception."" A Midsummer Night's Dreamwas written in 1595 or 1596 by William Shakespeare and has become one of his most famous plays, which has been a hit with both critics and audiences. In addition to many performances worldwide throughout the centuries, the hit play has also been adapted into a wide variety of creative works from film to opera, ballet, and more. One such opera was the 1692 show,The Fairy-Queen, by Henry Purcell, and in 1964, a musical adaptation of the play calledBabes in The Wooddebuted on Broadway."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,"3rd December, 2024"   ,"18th January, 2025"   ,               ,Barbican Centre                         ,"Silk Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2Y 8DS"

Starring Tracy-Ann Oberman as Shylock, and with the action moved to 1930s east London, it’s a timely indictment of antisemitism and a must-see event – so make sure you book The Merchant of Venice 1936 tickets on London Theatre now. Shakespeare’s drama sees the Jewish moneylender Shylock demanding a pound of flesh from merchant Antonio, only to have the tables turned during a climactic trial in which religious discrimination is baked into this society’s form of justice. Debate has long raged over whether Shakespeare’s text is itself antisemitic or not, but certainly this riveting new version,The Merchant of Venice 1936, is extremely clear in how it uses a real-life setting to reframe the story – and to speak to today through the prism of recent history. Directed by Brigid Larmour, the production creates a female, East End Shylock whose business is situated on Cable Street – where, in 1936, there really were battles between Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirts and anti-fascist protesters. Here, Shylock and her family are under attack right from the start. Following its critically acclaimed and hugely impactful UK tour, as well as a run at the Criterion Theatre earlier this year,The Merchant of Venice 1936returns to the West End for an encore run. Oberman reprises her pioneering performance of Shylock as a formidable Jewish matriarch fighting for her rights – and her family.

Spring 1747, Potsdam, Prussia. Johann Sebastian Bach reluctantly visits the court of Frederick II, Europe’s most ambitious and dangerous leader. The two men could hardly be more different. Bach is deeply religious, Frederick is an atheist. Bach loathes war, Frederick revels in it. Bach studies scripture, Frederick reads military history. Frederick remains in awe of Bach’s genius however and has mischievously prepared a musical conundrum that he hopes will baffle the composer and amuse his court. The explosive events of the following days could not have been predicted by either man. Brian Cox’s glittering career has spanned more than sixty years, garnering numerous awards, working with the most esteemed theatre companies and renowned Hollywood and TV directors. Twice Olivier Award winner for Best Actor, his portrayal in the HBO hit series Succession has won him a Golden Globe award and Emmy nominations. He is joined in the cast by Nicole Ansari-Cox who studied at the prestigious Actors’ Studio in New York and has starred regularly on stage and screen in the UK and the US. Her major credits include Deadwood, The Biographer and Blumenthal on screen, and starring in Tom Stoppard’s Rock’n’Roll at the Royal Court and on Broadway. Former artistic director of the National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company, Trevor Nunn’s multi-award winning repertoire ranges from Les Misérables to The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.

Agatha Christie wroteWitness for the Prosecutionin 1925. The original story was published in Flynn’s, a weekly detective magazine circulated in early 20th-century Britain. According to her autobiography,Witness for the Prosecutionwas one of Agatha Christie’s favourites of all her works, stating: “One night at the theatre stands out in my memory especially; the first night ofWitness[for the Prosecution]. I can safely say that that was the only first night I have enjoyed… It was one of my plays that I like best myself.” We'd like to think that theWitness for the ProsecutionWest End production would be loved by Christie too. It’s even more impressive thatWitness for the Prosecutionperformances occur in a real court. London County Hall opened on 17 Jul. 1922, and served as the headquarters of local government for London for 64 years. When you’re watching the show, you’ll see the octagonal Council Chamber at the centre of County Hall — it once provided seating for over 200 council members and four galleries overlooking the Chamber for the public and members of the press. It’s the ideal immersive setting for an Agatha Christie courtroom drama. Christie’s court classic sees Leonard Vole called to the stand after a murder. When his wife agrees to testify, can she be trusted? It’s up to you, the audience as the jury, to decide whether Vole will walk free or spend the rest of his life in shackles. Developed with the support and involvement of the Christie family, Lucy Bailey directs the new production to place audiences in the centre of the action within the courtroom.

BookMy Neighbour Totorotickets on London Theatre. My Neighbour Totoroin London has been a fan favourite since its premiere in 2022. In fact, the show broke the Barbican Centre box-office record for ticket sales in a single day. In 2023, the show also earned an impressive six Olivier awards, including for costume design, direction, and set design. The imaginative production tells the story of young girls, Satsuki and Mei, who relocate to the countryside with their father following their mother’s hospitalization. During their summer adventures, they encounter numerous woodland spirits, including the furry giant Totoro. My Neighbour Totorois a play with an immensely talented creative team, including those who earned Olivier Awards for their work on the show’s run at the Barbican. This includes direction by Phelim McDermott, production design by Tom Pye, costume design by Kimie Nakano, lighting design by Jessica Hung Han Yun, and sound design by Tony Gayle. Additionally, the puppetry by puppetmaster Basil Twist inMy Neighbour Totorois truly exceptional. The fleet of puppets, from chickens to Totoros, is a new style of puppetry that the creative team calls “wind spirits.” “We’ve got an on-stage ensemble of puppeteers. They’ve got their own costumes that help them be invisible at certain points, but they’re a presence. And they are like storytellers. It’s a little bit like in the movie, if you suddenly got to see the animators who were making that cartoon happen,” McDermotttold The Standard."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,"8th March, 2025"      ,"2nd November, 2025"   ,               ,Gillian Lynne Theatre                   ,"166 Drury Lane, London, United Kingdom, WC2B 5PW"

BookThe Little Foxestickets on London Theatre. The Little Foxesis a play set in Alabama in 1900. Regina Hubbard (Anne-Marie Duff) desires freedom and wealth, but 20th-century society makes that incredibly difficult, especially when men are considered the only legal heirs. She watches as her two brothers manage the family inheritance, and soon, Regina creates a plan to obtain substantial wealth. But what will the repercussions of her schemes be? Anne-Marie Duff said of the play, “The Little Foxesis a formidable play by a formidable writer – I couldn’t put it down. It’s a searing drama about corruption, betrayal and the relentless pursuit of power. At the heart of it is Regina, a charismatic yet ruthless character who, when the reins are unleashed, goes full force to take matters into her own hands.” The Little Foxesin London has an excellent creative team, including Olivier Award-winning director Lyndsey Turner (The Witches, The Crucible), designer Lizzie Clachan (The Witches), lighting designer Lucy Carter (The Marriage of Figaro), sound designer Tingying Dong (A Doll’s House), and fight director Kev McCurdy (The Wizard of Oz). The Little Foxesopened on Broadway on 15 February 1939, starring Tallulah Bankhead as Regina Hubbard. The show ran for 410 performances on Broadway before it began to tour the United States. Since then, there have been numerous revivals, and Lillian Hellman also wrote a screenplay for a film version of the play, which came out in 1941 and starred Bette Davis, Herbert Marshall, and Teresa Wright.

BookOedipustickets on London Theatre. Oedipusis a play that tells the story of a politician on the eve of election victory. There is an air of hope as policy pledges are made, but soon, those promises come back to haunt him. This explosive thriller sets the stage for explorations of honesty and cover-ups as Oedipus' fate has already been cast. Oedipusin London stars Olivier Award-winning and Tony Award-nominated Mark Strong (A View From the Bridge) as Oedipus and Olivier Award-winning and Emmy Award-nominated Lesley Manville (Ghosts, The Crown) as Jocasta. Please note:There is no readmittance to the auditorium once the performance has begun. The show will begin promptly and there's a strict no latecomers policy. The play also features an exceptional creative team, including director Robert Icke. Icke, who also wrote the adaptation, is known for his modern adaptations of classics, such as his transformation ofOresteiain 2015. Icke toldThe GuardianofOedipus, ""The challenge was to provide for an audience today the impact and immediacy of the original before we all knew its twists and turns."" The creative team also includes Olivier Award-winning scenic designer Hildegard Bechtler (After the Dance), costume designer Wojciech Dziedzic (The Crucible), Tony and Olivier Award nominated lighting designer Natasha Chivers (Prima Facie), Olivier Award-winning sound designer Tom Gibbons (People, Places & Things), and video designer Tal Yarden (Ali (The Musical)). The show had successful runs at the Internationaal Theatre Amsterdam and the Edinburgh Festival before coming to the London stage.

If you love the original show, you'll find Faulty Towers The Dining Experience a unique, novel pleasure and unmissably great fun. It doesn't replicate the TV scripts. Rather, its three performers inhabit the spirit of Torquay's most inept hoteliers Basil, Sybil and Manuel to a 'T', and you'll be caught up in their madcap melee even as you dig in to your 3-course lunch or dinner. This 5-star, critically acclaimed production has been in constant demand throughout Australia, Europe, Ireland, Scandinavia, the United Arab Emirates and the UK ever since its Australian debut in 1997. While it portrays the spirit of the TV characters and the atmosphere they create, please note that the performers are impersonators, and that the show has no connection to John Cleese, Connie Booth or their original scripts, or to the BBC."

It’s human nature. A secret marriage changes the course of two ancient kingdoms. For the first time in ten years, see Cymbeline, Shakespeare’s late, tragic comedy of love and rebellion, in the candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. Cymbeline is queen of ancient Britain. When her daughter, Imogen, secretly marries against her mother’s will, Posthumus is banished to Rome. In exile, Posthumus places a bet on Imogen’s innocence, a gamble they will soon regret.

The five women playing the five versions of the main character are the incredibly talented Olivier-winning actress Deborah Findlay (BBC’sThe Split), Golden Globe Award-nominated actress Romola Garai (The Hour), BAFTA award-winning actress Gina McKee (Dear England), Anjli Mohindra (Noises Off) and Harmony Rose-Bremner (Hamnet). All five women are reprising their roles from the Almeida Theatre performances. The Yearsin London has an excellent creative team, including the artistic director of International Theatre Amsterdam, Eline Arbo, who is the director and adapter, and Stephanie Bain, head of programming and literary at the Almeida Theatre, who is the English adapter. Juul Dekker is the set designer, Rebekka Wörmann is the costume designer, and Varja Klosse is the lighting designer. This impactful play’s Dutch adaptation premiered in The Hague in 2022 before coming to Almeida Theatre in the summer of 2024 for it's English premiere, where it was a hit with audiences and critics. As the 5-starIndependent reviewsaid of the show, “Ultimately, it is the emotional experience of seeing an entire existence lived on stage; a fairly unremarkable life made utterly remarkable.”"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,"24th January, 2025"   ,"19th April, 2025"     ,               ,Harold Pinter Theatre                   ,"6 Panton Street, London, United Kingdom, SW1Y 4DN"

Strike the colours. The pirates are back. The ENO’s smash-hit production of Gilbert & Sullivan’s swashbuckling farce returns shortly – and is set to get audiences toe-tapping along all over again. With its splendidly silly storyline, wild wordplay and well-loved songs, this Mike Leigh-created production is irresistibly feel-good. An apprentice pirate woos the Major General’s daughter, while his bungling buccaneer-shipmates try to outwit an equally inept party of policemen. Its vibrant staging brings out the sunshine in the story. The Pirates of Penzance is one of Gilbert & Sullivan’s most popular operas and contains some of their most memorable melodies. These include ‘I am the Very Model of a Modern Major General’, ‘A Policeman’s Lot is Not a Happy One’ and ‘With Cat-like Tread’. This revival is directed by Sarah Tipple and conducted by Natalie Murray Beale. G&S favourites and ENO regulars Richard Suart and John Savournin are the Major General and the Pirate King respectively. Meanwhile, ENO Harewood Artist Isabelle Peters sings the role of Mabel, and former Harewood artist William Morgan is Frederic. Co-production with Les Théâtres de la Ville de Luxembourg and the Saarländische Staatstheater Saarbrücken.

Following five-star reviews in 2024, Mary Skeaping’s enthralling production returns to the London Coliseum for one week only. A young peasant girl, Giselle, is in love with Albrecht, a Duke who hides his title and his engagement to another. When Giselle discovers he has deceived her, she is driven to madness, and dies of a broken heart. Late at night, the Wilis gather by her grave, ready to welcome her into their fold as the vengeful spirits of betrayed brides, who force men to dance to their death.

BookCirque du Soleil Corteotickets on London Theatre. Cirque du Soleil Corteois a circus show that seamlessly weaves mesmerising acrobatics and jaw-dropping stunts with the story of the clown Mauro imagining his funeral as a festive parade and carnival atmosphere. The nameCorteocomes from the Italian word 'cortège,' which means procession, and refers to the parade Mauro vividly imagines. Since its 2005 premiere in Montreal,Corteohas been beloved by audiences worldwide. The show has been performed on four continents and 22 countries. Cirque du Soleil Corteoin London is making history as the Royal Albert Hall is being reconfigured for the staging. The stage splits the Hall in half, with the two halves of the audience facing each other. Additionally, this is the heaviest show Cirque du Soleil has brought to the Royal Albert Hall, suspending 67 tonnes from the grid. Director of Programming for the Royal Albert Hall, Matt Todd,  said, ""This is our 29th year welcoming Cirque du Soleil to the Royal Albert Hall, and this is the first time that we have been able to reconfigure the Hall like this, dramatically and uniquely changing the whole perspective within the auditorium. It is wonderful for the Hall to be used in this way and will without doubt be one of Cirque du Soleil's most extraordinary performances."" The show is written and directed by Daniele Finzi Pasca (Cirque du Soleil Luzia), and its stunning score is by Philippe Leduc and Maria Bonzanigo. Jean-François Côté and Michel A.

BookBallet Shoestickets on London Theatre. Ballet Shoesis a play that tells the story of three adopted sisters, Pauline, Petrova, and Posy. They are taken in by a professor and palaeontologist, who leaves the girls with two charges. The sisters seek to find their place in the world and chase their dreams despite the world being a difficult place for ambitious women. As the 4-starLondon Theatre reviewsaid of the show, “This new adaptation by Kendall Feaver hits the sweet spot, thankfully retaining the 1930s setting and celebrating what a visionary Streatfeild was with her focus on young women shaping their own destinies, the importance of technique and hard graft, and the gift of found families.” Ballet Shoesin London has an excellent cast starring Grace Saif (13 Reasons Why), Yanexi Enriquez  (Though This Be Madness), Daisy Sequerra (Matilda), and Pearl Mackie (Doctor Who). The show’s talented creative team includes director Katy Rudd (The Ocean at the End of the Lane), set designer Frankie Bradshaw (Mad House), costume designer Samuel Wyer (The Ocean at the End of the Lane), choreographer Ellen Kane (Matilda the Musical), composer Asaf Zohar (Disruption), Tony and Olivier Award-winning lighting designer Paule Constable (The Ocean at the End of the Lane), Tony and Olivier Award-winning sound designer Ian Dickinson (Company), and projections by Ash J Woodward (The Witches). As the 4-starThe Guardian reviewsaid, “Samuel Wyer’s costumes dazzle and Frankie Bradshaw’s set is no less than luminous with GUM’s ancient exhibits in glass cases spiralling upwards, across the house’s storeys, while Ash J Woodward’s video projections and Paule Constable’s lighting create the almost magical effect of movement: dinosaurs lurch and sea waves swish across the stage.”"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,"26th November, 2024"  ,"22nd February, 2025"  ,               ,Olivier Theatre                         ,"National Theatre, South Bank, London, United Kingdom, SE1 9PX"

This is the world premiere of a new translation by playwright Rory Mullarkey. ‘Everything’s fine. It is.’ Three Sisters. Their brother, and his fiancé. The teacher, the doctor, the old woman, and the soldiers stationed nearby. A small town, in the middle of nowhere. Their world is going up in flames, one minute at a time. But can they create the change they’re longing for? One of the most influential literary artists of his time, this season Anton Chekhov shares the stage with Shakespeare as we explore the transformative impact they both continue to have on how we think and feel about the world. Caroline Steinbeis (The Contingency Plan, Rutherford and Son, Sheffield Crucible) returns to the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse to direct this twentieth century classic. ‘In two hundred, three hundred years, life on Earth will be unimaginably wonderful, amazing! Human beings need that kind of life, and if it doesn't exist yet, we need to feel it in the air, wait for it, dream about it, get ready for it.’ Assisted PerformancesCaptioned: 4th March 7:30pm & 12th April 2pmAudio Described: 5th March 2pm & 17th March 7:30pmRelaxed: 7th March 7:30pm, 13th March 2pm & 15th March 2pm"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,"31st January, 2025"   ,"19th April, 2025"     ,               ,Sam Wanamaker Playhouse                 ,"21 New Globe Walk, Bankside, London, UK, SE1 9DT"

With standing tickets, you’ll be swept to Manhattan and Havana all in one night. London Theatre couldn’t stop shouting about the show, saying: “ “You’ve simply gotta gamble”. And when it pays off, as [director Nicholas] Hytner proves, the rewards are boundless.” When Manhattan gambler Nathan Detroit needs to find a new location for his crap shooting games, he calls upon Sky Masterson. The pair settle on a bet: Nathan bets Sky that he can’t take a woman of his choosing on a date. Everything changes when they meet Salvation Army sergeant Sarah Brown.

Cher Horowitz is the most popular student at Beverly Hills High, renowned for her unique talent at finding love for others. She's about to embark on her biggest project yet – making over her awkward new friend, Tai, and setting her up with the most handsome boy in school. But what happens to Cher when, for the first time, everything is not perfect?

With hostile forces on every side, Mary I of Scotland attempts to secure a happy future for herself and her country. One of Scotland’s most esteemed composers, Thea Musgrave captures the drama in a thrilling, atmospheric score rooted in the rough-hewn Highlands of Elizabethan times. Caught between her drunken husband, her scheming half-brother, and her untrustworthy lover, Mary I of Scotland must find a way to protect her country and her Catholic faith. Each new conversation reveals a treacherous twist as she is betrayed or misled by those closest to her. Until finally a terrible miscalculation causes her to fall into the arms of her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth I. Thea Musgrave writes music and libretto that is as beautifully crafted for voices as for the drama. Her orchestral textures are deftly detailed, at times evoking Elizabethan Scotland. This provides the backdrop for characters who are both musically as well as dramatically believable while cleverly building tension. As critic Harold Rosenthal notes, Musgrave’s music is both original and accessible. Conducting this modern masterpiece is Joana Carniero, who makes a welcome ENO return after she conducted The Handmaid’s Tale in 2022 and 2024. Soprano Heidi Stober will bring Musgrave’s radiant melodies to life on stage as Queen Mary. She will be joined by two former ENO Harewood Artists Alex Otterburn as James Stewart, Earl of Moray and Nicky Spence as James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell. Also making a welcome return is bass Alastair Miles as Lord Gordon. Libretto by Thea Musgrave based on Amalia Elguera’s play Moray."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,"15th February, 2025"  ,"18th February, 2025"  ,               ,London Coliseum                         ,"St Martin's Lane, London, United Kingdom, WC2N 4ES"

When two penniless actresses meet in Shanghai at auditions for Ibsen’s A Doll’s House, they quickly become inseparable. But as political upheaval rips through China, their tumultuous friendship will alter not only the course of their lives, but the course of history. One will become China’s first female director.

Join double Emmy-award nominee Nick Mohammed in the guise of his critically acclaimed alter-ego Mr. Swallow alongside a star-studded cast for an all-singing, all-dancing comedy retelling of Dickens’ festive classic. When Santa cancels Christmas on Christmas Eve, he’s visited by three ghosts who must convince him to see the error of his ways and rediscover the magic of Christmas. But with mere hours to go, and only one working reindeer, how will he deliver everything on time?! Taskmaster loser and Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed is joined by Ghosts’ Martha Howe-Douglas, Borderline’s David Elms and Two Doors Down’s Kieran Hodgson.

Ten years before he becomes the first Black man to win the Oscar for Best Actor, this gripping drama captures the moment a young Sidney Poitier prepares to sign a career-defining Hollywood contract that could make him a star. But there’s a catch. Will he put his career before his principles? In a time of betrayals, will he name names? Will he sign his life away? Inspired by real events, this 'exceptional' (The Guardian) play directed by the Kiln Theatre's Artistic Director Amit Sharma, features Ivanno Jeremiah (Constellations) reprising his 'tremendous' (Time Out) performance as Sidney Poitier, opposite Stanley Townsend (Netflix's Kaos) and Oliver Johnstone (Antigone).

Set on a single day, it packs in a dazzling procession of madcap comic schemes and setbacks, all of which are punctuated by some of the most sublime music ever written. This is Mozart at the height of his powers. When the cheating Count Almaviva makes advances on Susanna, his servant’s wife-to-be, Figaro’s marriage threatens to end before it has started. The household takes sides. Deception, disguise and double cross are the result, as the warring factions make Figaro’s love-life a comic battleground. Considered one of the greatest operas ever written, The Marriage of Figaro has a masterful balance of light and shade. Its playful, bubbling overture carries its pace and comic tone. Meanwhile the arias and ensemble pieces capture the rich characterisation and the deeply moving rift – and reconciliation – of Figaro and Susannah. Many of the arias are now world famous, including ‘Voi che sapete’ (‘Tell me what love is’) and ‘Non piú andrai’ (‘Here’s an end to your life as a wanderer’) which is performed yearly at Trooping the Colour. One of the most gifted directors of his generation, Joe Hill-Gibbins brings an exciting new energy to this classic opera. It’s a bold, contemporary take that accentuates Mozart’s overtures and arias with a pared back staging, which brings out the production’s wit and comedic characters. Former ENO Harewood Artist, David Ireland sings the title role. Internationally renowned British soprano and another former ENO Harewood Artist, Mary Bevan is Susannah, his fiancée.

BackgroundAdele Thomas’ production lights up the stage with ‘anarchic imagination’ (Guardian), combining Hieronymus Bosch-inspired mayhem and medieval lore. Three unique casts are led by conductors Giacomo Sagripanti and Carlo Rizzi to bring Verdi’s dark and disturbing tale to energetic life. Drama and energyVerdi wrote Il trovatore hot on the heels of Rigoletto, and its premiere came only two months before that of La traviata. But Il trovatore, while no less popular than these other operas, is quite different. Verdi himself had suggested the source material, Antonio García Gutiérrez’s play El trovador (1836), to his librettist Salvatore Cammarano. At the anvilIl trovatore is probably best known for the ‘Anvil Chorus’, Azucena’s ‘Stride la vampa’ (The flame crackles!) and Manrico’s heroic ‘Di quella pira’ (The flames of the pyre). But Verdi wrote wonderful music for all four of his leads, with the aristocratic ‘Il balen del suo sorriso’ (The flashing of her smile) for the Count, and Leonora’s prayer ‘D’amor sull’ali rosee’ (On the rosy wings of love) among a host of thrilling ensembles and chorus numbers."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,"26th February, 2025"  ,"22nd March, 2025"     ,               ,Royal Opera House                       ,"Bow St, London, UK, WC2E 9DD"

And we will make this place our place.” The Bains’ corner shop in Wolverhampton has been at the centre of the family for three generations. In 1969, Mrs Bains is balancing running the business, caring for her ailing husband and the demands of her two headstrong daughters, who each have their eye on a different kind of future.

Only problem is he doesn’t have a band. Yet. With a score that embraces the new wave sounds of the 80s, Sing Street is an ode to the thrill of young love and a celebration of the power of music to lift us up."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,"8th July, 2025"       ,"23rd August, 2025"    ,               ,Lyric Hammersmith                       ,"King Street, Lyric Square, London, United Kingdom, W6 0QL"

In an entirely average hotel basement somewhere in Birmingham, three speedsters are summoned to his class with a choice: change your ways, or lose your licence. But a routine training course quickly veers into a tumultuous group therapy session as they are forced to confront the real question: why are you all so angry?

The family home is more than merely a building. It can be a destination of pilgrimage, an inherited investment, a repository of memory or even magic. And, for brother and sister Stephen and Billie, home is all they have. Mucking along in their decaying farmhouse, they’re doing just fine.

BookA Good Housetickets on London Theatre. A Good Houseis a play set in a gated community. The show tells the story of a mysterious shack that appears and causes endless speculation among the neighbours, especially when the shack's inhabitants are nowhere to be seen. Through satire, the play explores community politics and the limits of good neighbourliness. The talented cast includes Kai Luke Brummer (Moffie), Olivia Darnley (Ugly Lies the Bone), Mimi M Khayisa (The Witcher), Sifiso Mazibuko (Ain't Too Proud), Robyn Rainsford (Tali's Joburg Diary), and Scott Sparrow (The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time). A Good Housealso has a talented creative team led by director Nancy Medina, whose direction ofChoir Boyearned the Best Director award at the 2024 The Black British Theatre Awards. Royal Court Artistic Director David Byrne said, ""The chance to work with Nancy and her world-class team at Bristol Old Vic to bring Amy Jephta's astonishing play to audiences is, therefore, quite literally a dream come true."" The creative team behindA Good Housealso includes design by ULTZ (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom), lighting design by Chris Davey (Richard III), costume supervision by Lucy Walshaw (A Kind of People), and the casting director is Arthur Carrington (Dr Strangelove).

When Rodolfo, a penniless poet, meets Mimì, a seamstress, they fall instantly in love. Rodolfo introduces Mimì to his bohemian friends Marcello, Colline and Schaunard, and the group heads to Café Momus, where Marcello reunites with his ex-girlfriend Musetta.

BackgroundRobert Carsen’s ‘transformative’ (Financial Times) production situates Verdi’s large-scale political drama in a contemporary world, framing power struggles and toxic jealousies in a modern, totalitarian state. Daniel Oren conducts Verdi’s monumental score, with Anna Pirozzi as Aida, Riccardo Massi as Radames, Ekaterina Semenchuk as Amneris and Amartuvshin Enkhbat as Amonasro. An Egyptian Opera?‘Cyprus; Spain; Jerusalem; Paris; the banks of the Euphrates; Mantua. The operas of Giuseppe Verdi are set in a variety of diverse locales, depicted in some detail in the set descriptions contained in the librettos,’ writes Francesco Izzo, in his Aida programme article. While many contemporary iterations of Aida have seen directors stage Verdi’s story of love and war outside of a more outdated ‘Egyptian’ (read: elephants, pyramids) landscape, Izzo acknowledges that there can still be ‘little doubt that when the curtain rises at the beginning of the opera a sizeable majority of the audience will be expecting to find some rendition of the set description found in the libretto: “A hall in the King’s palace in Memphis …A large gate at the back, through which the temples and palaces of Memphis and the pyramids are visible.”’ A stark spectacleThe appeal, surely, is spectacle, the grand columns of said temples and palaces and colourful dance and chorus scenes the perfect recipe for a crowd-pleaser. But strip this away – as in Robert Carsen’s stark and deliberately cold staging – and Aida, at its core, is still a rich and deeply immersive story. Much like Verdi’s other popular operas (think Don Carlo, La forza del destino and Rigoletto), Aida captivates audiences with its tragic love story and with its poignant exploration of the unbreakable bond between father and daughter. It is these enduring themes, in the end, that allow us to think of Aida not as an ‘Egyptian’ opera, but a human one.

BookKyotoon London Theatre. Kyotois a play by Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson (The Jungle) that transports audience members to the Kyoto Conference Centre on 11 December 1997. The play tells the tale of the historic climate summit in which the nations of the world are in a deadlock as they seek to reach a negotiation for the first legally binding emissions targets. Kyotoin London has an excellent cast including Stephen Kunken (Billions), Jenna Augen (Leopoldstadt), Olivia Barrowclough (Theodosia), Jorge Bosch (Todos mienten), Nancy Crane (Design for Living), Andrea Gatchalian (Ikaria), Togo Igawa (Tetris), Kwong Loke (Sophocles' Antigone: The Burial at Thebes), Dale Rapley (As You Like It), Raad Raw (Sons of the Prophet), and Ferdy Roberts (Macbeth). The expert creative team includes Olivier award-winning directors Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin (Stranger Things: The First Shadow). ""Kyototells the story of a miraculous moment of agreement in which the seemingly impossible, became a reality.

BookThe Puriststickets on London Theatre. The Puristsis a play that premiered in 2019 at Huntington Theatre in Boston and it was directed by Tony and Emmy Award-winner, Billy Porter. The show earned the Elisabeth Osborn Award for Best Play and the Elliot Norton Award for Best Production. This award-winning play tells the story of a DJ, a former rapper, and an older Broadway telesales director who have become an unlikely group of friends as they spend time together on their stoop in Queens. However, things change when a rap battle breaks out between two young women. What begins as a spar about hip-hop music starts to reveal the characters' fears and struggles. Over time, it becomes clear that these seemingly different people have a lot more in common than one may have thought. As theBroadway World reviewsaid of the world premiere, “The Puristsis a delightful and at times breathtaking new play that is anything but pure and simple.” The Puristsin London stars Jasper Britton (Habeas Corpus), Tiffany Gray (Between Riverside and Crazy), Emma Kingston (In The Heights), Richard Pepple (High Life), and Sule Rimi (Blues for an Alabama Sky). The show also has an excellent creative team, including playwright Dan McCabe (Blame The Parents), director Amit Sharma (Pins and Needles), set designer Tom Piper (Hamnet), lighting designer Oliver Fenwick (Ulster American), sound designer Tony Gayle (Next To Normal), and costume designer Ruth Badila (1984). As Emma Kingston toldWest End Best Friend, ""It's always amazing to work on new productions and the playwright Dan McCabe is writing some new scenes for this version too so it really does feel fresh."""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,"14th November, 2024"  ,"21st December, 2024"  ,               ,Kiln Theatre                            ,"269 Kilburn High Road, London, United Kingdom, NW6 7JR"

Vilified by an envious elite and accused of treason, she strives to rebuild her public image to win the hearts of the American people. She turns to the world’s first celebrity photographer, Matthew Brady, who helped her husband, Abraham Lincoln, win the presidency. But their partnership unravels into a tense battle for creative control. As Mary fights to tell her story, the play delves into themes of power, identity, female agency, and the cost of representation. With a richly textured script by acclaimed artist, playwright, and historian John Ransom Phillips, Mrs President invites audiences into a gripping examination of history’s biases and the human need to define ourselves. Described as “evocative” and “unmissable,” this brand new London production brings to life an intimate and politically charged portrait of America’s most misunderstood First Lady."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,"31st January, 2025"   ,"16th March, 2025"     ,               ,Charing Cross Theatre                   ,"The Arches, Villiers Street, London, United Kingdom, WC2N 6NL"

Now firmly established as a modern day classic, this iconic production is perhaps best-known for replacing the traditional female corps de ballet with a menacing male ensemble. A Sadler's Wells Associate Artist, Matthew Bourne blends dance, humour and spectacle with extravagant, award-winning designs by Lez Brotherston, to create a provocative and powerfulSwan Lakefor our times. Collecting over 30 international theatre awards including three Tonys,Swan Lakehas been acclaimed as a landmark achievement on the international stage.

The show will utilise Vogue’s remarkable archive and contributor network to create an experience that brings together the industry’s leading voices from the past, present, and future. With first-hand testimony and a rich mixture of media, Inventing the Runway reveals how fashion shows became the ultimate statement of a designer’s vision – at times, a walking expression of their identity – reimagined season after season and year after year. It is a celebration of the imagination, discipline and passion that has revolutionised how we experience fashion. Through a cycle of thematic chapters, Inventing the Runway will use original animation in an experience that is both visceral and insightful, with immersive sound design and a score fusing original composition with classical and pop music, all of which will evoke the worlds when iconic shows shifted the cultural landscape.

So, when the Macbeths see their chance at the crown, why shouldn't they take it? But things don’t go according to plan. Dreams quickly turn to nightmares, humanity erodes, nature stirs.

A gripping opera of shame, betrayal and redemption. BackgroundCorinne Winters (Jenůfa) and Karita Mattila (the Kostelnička) lead in Janáček’s evocative opera with a score that is infused with traditional folk melodies of the composer’s native Moravia. Music Director Designate Jakub Hruša conducts Claus Guth’s staging which is an ‘edgy, evocative’ (Telegraph) take on this poignant domestic drama. The music of JenůfaJanáček’s folk-inspired music movingly captures Jenůfa’s progression from hope to despair to eventual radiant happiness, while her stepmother, the Kostelnička, is one of opera’s most complex maternal figures. Writer Nigel Simeone describes the unique structure of Janáček's stirring music as such: ‘Every character has his or her own musical language, and Janáček sets down a pattern that will serve him for all of his mature operas. A theme, often as short as four notes, dominates each scene [of the opera] but then gives way to another, equally memorable'. What is a Kostelnička?Jenůfa's stepmother is referred throughout Janáček’s opera as ‘the Kostelnička’, a title given to a village church-warden or elder. Initially presenting as a strong matriarch who is fiercely protective of Jenůfa, the Kostelnička has one of the more dramatic – and dark – character transformations across opera. As Jenůfa's future is turned increasingly precarious by her illegitimate child, the Kostelnička’s maternal instinct morphs into obsessive determination... In a small, stifling community, how far must a mother go to protect her child?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,"15th January, 2025"   ,"1st February, 2025"   ,               ,Royal Opera House                       ,"Bow St, London, UK, WC2E 9DD"

Same, tbh. Join Peter as he humps his ‘orrible little way around Neverland with Wendy, John and Michael in a constant battle with the villainous moral crusader, Captain Hook!

Rude, crude and not for prudes, this is the very adult, very hilarious, very demure pantomime from the creator of Death Drop, Cool Rider, Gals Aloud and written by Gareth Joyner (A Christmas Carole, Dick Whittington). Journey straight to the Phoenix Theatre to find out just how juvenile a show this is, how the hell we’re achieving the flying effects with no budget, and just exactly how are we going to deal with the cultural appropriation of “Princess Tiger Lilly” (but we’ll probably will just skim past that…)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,"2nd December, 2024"   ,"6th January, 2025"    ,               ,Phoenix Theatre                         ,"110 Charing Cross Rd, London, United Kingdom, WC2H 0JP"

Now an adult, Martin is about to embark on the ultimate adventure – fatherhood. As he navigates this whirlwind of emotions, he is pulled back to that pivotal moment in his past as he struggled to move beyond imagining what his life might have been. Second Best is a playful yet poignant new comedy about fate, near-misses and the winding paths life takes. It explores the ache of almost touching greatness and the humour and hope that come when dreams remain just out of reach. A story about the tender moments that shape us, Second Best is for anyone who has ever wondered about the road not taken, and whether the other life would have been as glittering as it looks.

The year is 1939, The blitz and not the ballroom kind.

Enroute to gay Paris, Kevin’s parents realise they’ve left their bébé at home… alone! After making the most of having the house to himself, Kevin realises his Christmas wish to make his family disappear might not be as great as it sounds. Especially when two bumbling burglars plan to take all they can from Kevin… and then rob the house. So it’s paint cans and hot knobs at the ready! A parody like no other! You can be too old for a lot of things, but you're never too old for this naughty Christmas extravaganza, you filthy animals!

Copla songs channel the queer and migrant experiences in Spain’s early musicals, hitting all the right notes for gay people who love to laugh and cry to divas and their melodramatic music. Copla once served as political tool against repression - first under Franco’s dictatorship, and later for Spanish LGBTQ communities. This cabaret show celebrates queer migrant identity and exposes its pitfalls: living away from one’s homeland, translating musicals loved while in childhood, reinterpreting queer-loved songs, and self-negotiating foreignness. Queer migrant performer Alejandro Postigo de-constructs the traditional Spanish songs and shares their historical significance for queer collectives, inviting the audience to be part of the dialogue. Through his performance of English Copla and sharing his life stories, you'll witness his rebirth as alter ego La Gitana, with live music, a drink in hand and lots of interaction."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,"14th January, 2025"   ,"26th January, 2025"   ,               ,The Other Palace - Studio               ,"12 Palace Street, London, United Kingdom, SW1E 5JA"

Four actors must battle hilarious mishaps and misbehaving props to tell the (massively) tragic story of Madame Bovary. Emma Bovary dreamed of love and adventure, but instead, she got… Charles. Determined not to let a dull marriage stand in her way, she throws herself into a whirlwind of forbidden desires, extravagant parties, and a string of questionable decisions. From sultry carriage rides to secret rendezvous, her misadventures are a perfect mix of comedy and calamity. Expect fast-paced humour, lightning-quick costume changes, and a story as touching as it is laugh-out-loud funny. Laugh and cry in equal measure as Emma chooses the wrong husband! Lose yourself in romantic love scenes featuring devastatingly handsome men.

Lucy and the other kids of Whiffington hadn’t – until one morning that’s exactly what happens! With a town full of children running wild, our reluctant hero and some unlikely friends begin to solve the mystery of a lifetime in a topsy-turvy, back-to-front and inside-out new world underneath her bed… the world of the Creakers! Based on the best-selling book by singer-songwriter and author Tom Fletcher (Christmasaurus, Space Band), and adapted for the stage by Miranda Larson, this is a story about how it’s often those who are different who end up making a difference.

When you’re stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea, the deep blue sea can sometimes look very inviting. In this powerful drama of passion versus loyalty, Hester Collyer, the daughter of a clergyman and wife of a judge is floundering in the closing stages of a hopeless affair. Freddie Page, her lover, a handsome but shallow ex-Battle of Britain pilot, is out of his depth in their relationship, overwhelmed by the strength of an emotion he is incapable of reciprocating… Olivier Award winner Tamsin Greig has been one of the country’s best-loved stage and screen actresses in a career spanning four decades. She won the Olivier for Best Actress in 2007 for Much Ado About Nothingand has been nominated for The Little Dog Laughed and Women on the Verge of a Breakdown.

Sent into the woods to look for strawberries, the hungry Hansel and Gretel are about to embark on a fantastic adventure. As they fall asleep, a fairy-tale world comes to life around them. But the mysterious forest is not always safe for children, and little do they know, something darkly delicious awaits them when they wake... They can’t believe their luck when they come across an edible house made of chocolate – but their host, a witch in disguise, has an insatiable appetite – for young children!

If it escapes its confines it could pose a grave threat to humanity. When there is a security breach, two coders are interrogated in a race against time to find out who has done what and why. This tense thriller from Beau Willimon delves headlong into the questions that rapidly advancing technology demands we confront: What does it mean to be human?

Hanks himself will provide the voiceover, accompanied by a spectacular original score by Anne Nikitin whose previous work includes the Apple TV+ hit series HIJACK starring Idris Elba and the cult heist movie American Animals starring Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,"2nd January, 2024"    ,"27th April, 2025"     ,               ,Lightroom                               ,"12 Lewis Cubitt Square, London, United Kingdom, N1C 4DY"

Using lo-fi special effects, miniature vehicles, puppetry, video and physical recreations of film language, Dimanche paints a witty and tender portrait of human ingenuity and stubborness when faced with the uncontrollable forces of nature."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,"29th January, 2025"   ,"1st February, 2025"   ,               ,Peacock Theatre                         ,"Portugal Street, London, United Kingdom, WC2A 2HT"

Lenny Henry, whose playwriting debut August in England was produced by The Bush in 2023, has generously agreed to host ‘An Evening With…’ with readings from the play alongside a Q&A session about his career and journey with the Bush, chaired by culture writer and podcaster Nancy Durrant. The venue works hard to develop pathways for talent development, many of which are in jeopardy. One valuable initiative is the annual Open Submissions call-out for scripts which provides an opportunity for writers without agents or connections to have their work read.  The Bush receives over 1,000 scripts each year and through this path has found new members to engage in their various development programmes, including the long-standing Bush Theatre’s Emerging Writers Group (EWG).  The Bush EWG has nurtured talented writers including including Benedict Lombe (Lava and Shifters), Beru Tessema (Wolves on Road) and Coral Wylie (Lavender, Hyacinth, Violet, Yew which opens next February) to develop award-winning main house productions and relies on Open Submissions to find fresh talent. However, this year the open script submissions scheme has had to adapt significantly. Lack of funds, and consistent raising costs, means the theatre hasn't been able to engage script readers and the programme is now at risk of dissolving. The Bush uniquely focuses on British and Irish writers with Black and Brown voices to the fore, and this vital link in the development of the theatrical canon risks being broken. Alongside this are further initiatives including workshops, access to the theatre’s literary team for writers, funded research and development periods for script development, employment opportunities for Assistant Directors, and community access to spaces around the building. The Bush has long been celebrated as a home for new writing and talent development, bringing to the public attention names including Waleed Akhtar, Simon Callow, Michaela Coel, Monica Dolan, Richard Gadd, James Graham, Arinzé Kene, Jonathan Harvey, Lucy Kirkwood, Benedict Lombe, Stephen Poliakoff, Alan Rickman, Simon Stephens, Jack Thorne, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Julie Walters, Tyrell Williams and Victoria Wood. Richard Gadd, whose international hit Baby Reindeer had its first London performances at Bush Theatre said, ‘The Bush Theatre is an incredible hub for new writing, going above and beyond in terms of supporting new voices in the industry. Everytime I go there, I am genuinely overawed by the breadth of talent they uncover and champion to the world. More often than not taking huge chances on first time writers looking for their first break in the industry. These opportunities are becoming rarer and rarer in an increasingly cautious industry operating in a cost of living crisis, which is why it is so important that spaces like the Bush Theatre exist. Of course Baby Reindeer would be nothing without the support they showed it early on in its development.’ Benedict Lombe, who developed and opened her play Shifters at the Bush before transferring to the West End this year said, ‘The Bush has given space to artists and stories simply not witnessed on other stages. And in doing so, continues to shift the very fabric of the ""canon"". From being on their Emerging Writers Group, to having both my debut (Lava) and follow-up play (Shifters) on their main stage - they have championed my voice, supported my craft and repeatedly proven that they invest in the long term development of artists - not just schemes. It remains one of the few places I have never been told that my work is a ""risk"". Places like the Bush are a lifeline for artists. We must ensure their survival for future generations’. Lenny Henry said, ‘Right now, the arts just aren’t getting the help they need, which is disastrous considering the huge amount they contribute to daily life and to the public purse. Innovative places like the Bush Theatre are vital to the local economy and also the development of new work, which is one of the reasons why I chose to do my debut play with them. Without the new writers, performers, backstage and technical staff that venues such The Bush bring to the fore, much of the theatre, films, and television we take for granted simply wouldn’t exist. It’s so important that these spaces thrive . I stand with everyone at The Bush and hope they get to continue their important work.’" ,"25th January, 2025"   ,"25th January, 2025"   ,               ,Bush Theatre                            ,"7 Uxbridge Road, Shepherd's Bush, London, United Kingdom, W12 8LJ"

No last minute rescue. This… right here… with you… is the best chance I’ve got…’ Jodie and Brad seem like they have it all. The house in the suburbs, the nice car, the fully stocked bar. But when the couple are faced with a devastating crisis, they must enlist the help of a mysterious acquaintance from Jodie’s past.

BackgroundMasses of dancers move as a mesmerising whole. Bodies, fluid and yearning, are bathed in shafts of light. A single voice emerges, a lament that distils the magnitude of human suffering. A journey begins...Crystal Pite, in her distinctive choreographic style, grapples with themes of safe passage, displacement, community and mortality. Set to Gorecki’s affecting Symphony of Sorrowful Songs, this award-winning work is a reminder of the power of human connection in our turbulent times. Powerful artIn Light of Passage, Crystal Pite reckons with the existential tensions of the human condition, masterfully demonstrating how art can move the soul and provoke thought. In the choreographer’s own words, ‘there is a profound optimism in putting something like this out into the world and connecting to each other through it. When people collaborate to create a work of art and an audience gathers to witness it, there is something very hopeful and powerful about the experience. I want to create conditions in the theatre where we can gather around what we cannot know and grapple with it, together.’ A record in classical music publishing historyLight of Passage is set to Polish composer Henryk Górecki’s Symphony No.3 (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs). Created in 1976 for a large orchestra and solo soprano, it would become a defining composition of the 20th century. The symphony had its big break in 1989 with a performance by the London Sinfonietta, conductor David Zinman and soprano Dawn Upshaw, which was recorded by Elektra Nonesuch and picked up by Classic FM. Played on rotation on airwaves around the country, it reached no.6 on the UK album charts of 1993. The recording would become the most popular contemporary classical CD ever, selling over a million copies.

TV and West End star Lee Mead then brings his brand-new show The Best of Me to the Vaudeville. And finally, Kerry Ellis (Wicked, We Will Rock You) closes with her much talked about show Queen of the West End. Westway Sessions celebrates the very best talent of musical theatre and the recording label Westway Music that has become the home to leading stars of the West End, Broadway, and musical theatre."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,"3rd February, 2025"   ,"17th March, 2025"     ,               ,Vaudeville Theatre                      ,"404 Strand, London, United Kingdom, WC2R 0NH"

He should just ignore it… But who would send him such a thing – and why did they put it in a cake box? Colin immediately finds himself battling all-new levels of existential angst. He’s really not built for this sort of scrutiny, and his instinctive response is to trawl through his entire life – turning everything over – convinced that he can channel Poirot and unmask the offending sender. But as his sister Lisa and her husband Brian desperately scramble to save him from heading down this particularly murky rabbit-hole, it isn’t long before Colin’s list of possible suspects has gotten way out of control and he’s ready to do whatever it takes to smoke the culprit out. The Gift is an irreverent comedy that unashamedly dives into the murky waters of past transgressions and modern-day vengeance, all-the-while fully prepared to get low down and dirty in the process. Because what should you do when someone tries to seriously upset your applecart? Should you take it in your stride? See the funny side?

Almost exclusively, they came from poor families. Their treble voices intact, castration promised those who survived a chance to earn fame and fortune by singing female roles in the opera. A few made it, but most didn’t and were swept aside. Stiletto, a new musical with Music and Lyrics by three-time Grammy nominee, Oscar and Golden Globe nominee Matthew Wilder (Disney’s Mulan), Book by double Olivier Award nominee Tim Luscombe (Noël Coward’s Easy Virtue, Terrence Rattigan’s The Browning Version and Harlequinade), is set in Venice, Europe’s opera capital. During the winter of 1730-31, Venice is a city bristling with opportunity where fortunes can be made but life is cheap. A city of lustre and intrigue with plenty of chances of success for Marco, who was castrated as a child to retain his perfect voice. Opera stars being the rock stars of their day, Marco is on course to be an 18th-century Jagger or Bowie, to snag a powerful patron and play leading roles. In a busy square he meets Gioia, confident, strong willed... and supremely talented. But despite her musical gifts, being the daughter of an African slave there’s no chance for her to fulfil her dreams. Marco recognises her talent and, sensing that they are both outsiders as well as sharing a love for music, they fall in love. In an attempt to get her on stage, Marco introduces Gioia to society and his patron, the Contessa Azzurra, but at the end of the evening, a body lies dead and Gioia is hauled off to prison. To free her, Marco must overcome the demons of his past and the morally corrupt forces of the present."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,"24th March, 2025"     ,"14th June, 2025"      ,               ,Charing Cross Theatre                   ,"The Arches, Villiers Street, London, United Kingdom, WC2N 6NL"

A big-hearted, irreverent rom-com, perfect for a feel-good Christmas treat. Cyrano is the most interesting person in any room – a wordsmith, a charmer. She works twice as hard and runs twice as fast as the pretty boys, because she’s deeply ashamed of something about herself. Enter Roxanne: brilliant and beautiful, with a penchant for poetry and a way with words, just like Cyrano. But Roxanne only has eyes for Yan: hot, manly Yan; all brawn-and-no-brains Yan; who is dumbstruck around Roxanne. Probably shy, right? Until suddenly he starts saying the most amazing things. But it’s not Yan writing these perfect love scenes, it’s Cyrano…"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,"11th December, 2024"  ,"11th January, 2025"   ,               ,Park Theatre                            ,"Clifton Terrace, Finsbury Park, London, United Kingdom, N4 3JP"

It’s basically people taking things from each other’ A 1000-year-old statue of the Boddhisattva Guan Yin lives in The British Museum. When it emerges that the statue was stolen from its original home, the museum attempts to deflect both the public response and controversial repatriation claims from the Chinese government. As statesmen scheme and grease their palms, beneath the statue witches dance, a cleaner prays, and spirits weep. Guan Yin’s gaze falls over the broken shards of human life from empires old and new.

That’s what you are now.’ A woman wakes up in 2075, in a body that is not her own. Fifty years ago, Bridget died in a car accident. Now, thanks to a technological breakthrough, she is back: her mind, her consciousness, in a synthetic body. Metal. Wires. But she’s still Bridget, isn’t she? She must be.

Soil-soaked jeans and dirt under their fingernails, 19-year-old Pip is trying to find themself through gardening. But with a Dad more interested in plants than people and a Mum stuck in the past, they’re left to ponder life’s questions alone. Until one day, they uncover a jacket in the attic that's been gathering dust. Bold, vibrant and very 80s, in its pocket lies a diary belonging to someone long gone. Swept up in the mystery, Pip is determined to dig into the past, unearthing secrets about an old friend their Mum and Dad don't want to talk about… This world-premiere production is written by Coral Wylie, directed by Debbie Hannan (Overflow), and with a cast including the writer alongside BAFTA and Olivier Award nominee Omari Douglas (It’s a Sin, Constellations).

Set timer. Run. Repeat. Mariam knows the army often drops small warning bombs – a knock on the roof – giving tenants in Gaza 5-15 minutes to evacuate before their home is destroyed.

A TALE OF REGRET When the bookish Tatiana meets Eugene Onegin, she is immediately besotted. Enigmatic and refined, he seems like a hero from one of her novels. Onegin rejects her, seeing only a naive country girl.Will a meeting at a ball many years later offer another chance at love? Background60 years after its creation, Onegin’s exploration of unrequited affection, impulsive choices and bitter regret still breaks hearts today. First opera, then balletJohn Cranko became acquainted with Alexander Pushkin’s verse-novel Eugene Onegin when he choreographed the dances for Pyotr Il'yich Tchaikovsky’s opera of the same name in 1952. He created his own distinctive version of Pushkin’s work in 1965 for the Stuttgart Ballet. Onegin displays all of Cranko’s genius as a narrative choreographer, featuring finely drawn characters who are transformed by the conflicts they face. A wide-ranging roleOnegin and Tatiana’s relationship is depicted through intense duets, such as the letter-writing scene, when the youthful Tatiana dances a dream pas de deux with her longed-for lover. The role of Tatiana offers a ballerina many challenges – the development of a bookish country girl into a sophisticated woman at the pinnacle of St Petersburg society requires dramatic sensibility and technical finesse. Cranko’s choreography incorporates an eclectic range of dance forms, including folk, modern, ballroom and acrobatic. An unexpected Tchaikovsky ballet?While Tchaikovsky is most famous for his music in Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker, his lesser-known works for piano form the basis of Kurt-Heinz Stolze’s soaring arrangements for Onegin. This includes selections from The Seasons, his opera Cherevichki and the symphonic fantasy Francesca da Rimini.

BackgroundDecorum descends into chaos in this piercing new opera of trauma and complicity. Acclaimed contemporary composer Mark-Anthony Turnage (Anna Nicole, Coraline) and librettist Lee Hall (Billy Elliott) come together with director Richard Jones (La bohème, Samson et Dalila) to adapt Oscar-winning filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg’s (The Hunt, Another Round) 1998 film. An international cast conducted by Edward Gardner and led by Allan Clayton, Stéphane Degout and Gerald Finley takes on this operatic world premiere. From Screen to StageThe Danish avant-garde film movement Dogme95 that became infamous within the world of cinema in the late nineties began with Festen (The Celebration), Thomas Vinterberg’s international breakthrough and the source material for composer Mark-Anthony Turnage. With fellow film director Lars von Trier (Nymphomaniac, Melancholia, Breaking the Waves – the latter two adapted into operas), Vinterberg created a manifesto that intentionally mimicked French film auteur François Truffaut’s ‘Une certaine tendance du cinema’, the Cahiers du cinéma article that had launched the French New Wave movement in 1954.The Dogme95 rules or ‘vows of chastity’, as named by von Trier and Vinterberg, were to be implemented, first and foremost, to allow traditional storytelling, raw performance style and specific themes greater focus. Elaborate special effects and technology were forbidden, while shooting was to be done on location, in natural light and with hand-held cameras. With this approach, it is perhaps unsurprising that Festen – its damning emotional revelations unvarnished by the artificial devices of popular cinema – is particularly conducive to the more organic and indeed dramatic setting of the stage. Festen has been adapted multiple times for the stage, including for the Almeida Theatre, in the West End and later on Broadway. The libretto for this opera has been adapted and created by Lee Hall, who wrote the screenplay for the film Billy Elliott."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,"11th February, 2025"  ,"27th February, 2025"  ,               ,Royal Opera House                       ,"Bow St, London, UK, WC2E 9DD"

Spectacular dramatisation and breath-taking dance is heightened by a live on-stage band performing specially commissioned music by Roman GianArthur and iconic Peaky tracks from Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, Radiohead, Anna Calvi, The Last Shadow Puppets, Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. Throughout Rambert’s packed-out UK theatre tour, long-time fans of the TV show and audiences coming to Peaky fresh, were united in their enthusiasm for this adaptation written by the series’ creator Steven Knight with direction and choreography by Rambert’s Artistic Director Benoit Swan Pouffer."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,"5th August, 2025"     ,"16th August, 2025"    ,               ,Sadler's Wells                          ,"Rosebery Avenue, London, UK, EC1R 4TN"

Helen Sharp is the long-suffering author (just ask her) who lives in her shadow. They have always been the best of frenemies…until Madeline steals Helen’s fiancé away. As Helen plots revenge and Madeline clings to her rapidly fading star, their world is suddenly turned upside down by Viola Van Horn, a mysterious woman with a secret that’s to die for. After one sip of Viola’s magical potion, Madeline and Helen begin a new era of life (and death) with their youth and beauty restored… and a grudge to last eternity.

In 1930s London ordinary people emerge from cheap boarding houses nightly to pour out their passions, hopes and dreams in the pubs and fog-bound streets of Soho and Fitzrovia. Step inside The Midnight Bell, a tavern where one particular lonely-hearts club gather to play out their lovelorn affairs of the heart; bitter comedies of longing, frustration, betrayal and redemption. Inspired by the work of the great English novelist Patrick Hamilton (Twenty Thousand Streets Under The Sky, Hangover Square) who created some of the most authentic fiction of his era; stories borne out of years of social interactions with the working man and woman at his favourite location – the London Pub. Master storyteller Bourne once again joins forces with the Olivier and Tony award-winning team of Terry Davies, Lez Brotherston, Paule Constable and Paul Groothuis, and features fourteen of New Adventures’ finest performers in roles that will challenge and reveal the darker reaches of the human heart. The Midnight Bell premiered to great acclaim in 2021 and received five nominations at the 2022 National Dance Awards, with Matthew Bourne winning the award for Best Modern Choreography and Michela Meazza for Outstanding Female Modern Performance."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,"10th June, 2025"      ,"21st June, 2025"      ,               ,Sadler's Wells                          ,"Rosebery Avenue, London, UK, EC1R 4TN"
